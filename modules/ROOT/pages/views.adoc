= Views

Luminesce views are very similar to SQL-Providers.

Those providers (created vis Sql.Db) allow for writing SQl that runs directly against SQL Databases, while inserting MACROS to allow for efficient filter / join handling and PARAMETER handling.

Luminesce views are created by using Sys.Admin.SetupView this has a similar but reduced set of options and supports the same MACRO syntax.

Both of those Direct Providers may spin up and maintain Providers (but they are not required to do so).

These views simply run against the same instance of Luminesce.
