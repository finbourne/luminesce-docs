= Luminesce

Luminesce is a Data Virtualisation System within the Finbourne suite of products.

== Why Data Virtualisation?

Not all data is nicely sitting in one repository. Or even in one kind of repository (SQL, Hadoop, Elasticsearch, APIs - like JIRA or LUSID! The list is endless). 
Needing to use hundreds of systems to get at that is a nightmare for end users, developers, BAs, everyone.

Yet so much of that data is related in some way (And even if it isn't you still want one access path to rule them all).

Some organizations then build massive data copies. Let's call them Data Lakes. 
Oh my, that's so 2015. 
(Seriously, copying your data, maintaining those copies, processes to collate it all into one place, paying for it... all that before you can use any of it. Not cool.)

Enter Luminesce.
