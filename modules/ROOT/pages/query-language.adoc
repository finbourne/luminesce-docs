= Query Language

LuminesceSql is very closely derived from SQLite's SQL syntax.

In general most all of the SELECT symantics of SQLite are supported while none of the DDL or other commands are (with a few exceptions).

SELECT syntax differences:

* Common Table Expressions (CTEs) are not supported - But a simple reusable variable syntax is instead (usable for table variables and scalar variables)
* TYPES keyword can proceed SELECT statements in order to force certain column types in cases when those types are not derived from a provider with certainty.

Expression syntax differences:

* Date and DateTime constants should be written as #yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss# so surrounded by # not '.
* use [with] ... enduse : support for Direct Providers' arbitrary syntax.
