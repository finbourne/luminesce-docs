= Getting Started with Luminesce

In this guide we will learn how to get up and running with Luminesce.

(I'm guessing what the steps would be)

== Create LUSID Account

You'll first need to create and login to your LUSID account.
For more details on how to do this, see:

* xref:lusid::how-to/get-started/create-account.adoc[]
* xref:lusid::how-to/get-started/login-account.adoc[].

Once you've done that you're ready to start using Luminesce.

== Enable Luminesce

Something something, set this config to enable it.

== Luminesce Web API

Navigate to Luminesce Web API at https://<your-domain>.lusid.com/app/data-virtualisation/query-editor
You should see the following screen:

Now you can write a query against LUSID's default data.

[source, sql]

SELECT *
FROM Lusid.Instrument
